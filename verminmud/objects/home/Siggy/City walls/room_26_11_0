(field longDescription #496:These walls are atleast 15 feet above the ground level. The walls are well made and are hefty work. You can see guard patrols moving around the walls. There's a great view opening outside the city. First the grassy plains which lead to a huge thick forest, you can even see the sea far away. In east, you can see the river splitting up a forest and heading to the mountains. To southeast you can see a road crossing river and a small forest after going through plains, ending up to the mountains.)
