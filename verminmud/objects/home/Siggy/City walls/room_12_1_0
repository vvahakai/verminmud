(field description #30:You are standing on city walls)
(field longDescription #428:These walls are atleast 15 feet above the ground level. The walls are well made and are hefty work. You can see guard patrols moving around the walls. There's a great view opening outside the city. To north there are the grassy plains which lead to a huge thick forest, you can even see the sea far away.
In northwest you can see river going through the plains between hills and forest, ending up to a swamp and finally the sea.)
