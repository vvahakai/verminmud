(field description #30:You are standing on city walls)
(field longDescription #397:These walls are atleast 15 feet above the ground level. The walls are well made and are hefty work. You can see guard patrols moving around the walls. There's a great view opening outside the city. When you look west you can see that this is the place where mountains come nearest to the city. 
To north there are grassy plains which lead to a huge thick forest, you can even see the sea far away.)
