(field longDescription "This is a strange stone and metal construct evidently designed for mining. It's vaguely humanoid in shape, but instead of hands it has two sharp-edged shovel like appendages, which it constantly uses to deliver powerful blows to the stone wall of the shaft. It seems that though the masters of these automatons have abandoned them long ago, they have continued to carry out their last orders through the ages.")
