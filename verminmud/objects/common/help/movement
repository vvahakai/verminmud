Help on: movement

Moving around is done by typing the name of the exit.
Available exits are shown when looking around the room
or moving.

Moving multiple rooms at once can be done by prefixing
the direction with a number and space. For example
commanding '10 w' (without the quotes) will move ten
rooms west. 

For moving whole terrain types at once you can type the
direction in capital letters. For example commanding 'SE'
(again without the quotes) will move south-east until
the terrain type changes.

All movement commands have a builtin maximum of moving
only 50 rooms per command.
