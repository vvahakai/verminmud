This channel is intended mainly for developer use, but if you notice a 
bug or have other problems of a technical nature with the game, you may 
report them here. All messages are logged and read, so even if you don't 
get a reply, your concerns will be noted.

This channel is also a good way to contact the wizards for a chat if you 
feel like you would want to contribute for the developement effort.

Otherwise, well... do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they 
subtle and quick to anger.
