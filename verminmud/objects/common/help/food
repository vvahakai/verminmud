Help on: food

Moving around, being in battle and using skills and spells
decrease your sustenance points. When sustenance drops
below a certain level, you will not regenerate as quickly.

To regain sustenance, you must eat. Some races can eat corpses
of defeated enemies, but most will have to prepare food by
tinning corpses into cans of meat (use a tinning kit and the
tinning skill) or buy food from the grocery store.
