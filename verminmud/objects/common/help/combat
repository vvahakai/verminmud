Help on: combat

Fighting and defeating monsters is the main way of
earning experience in VerminMUD. You can engage in
combat with the command 'kill <target>', or using
an offensive skill on them with the command 'use
<skillname> at <target>'.

You can observe the status of your opponent with
the command 'scan' while in battle.

If you have trouble following the battle messages,
try turning the round markers with the command
'set showrounds on'. For other helpful settings
see 'help settings'.

There are many guilds in Vermin which can train you
to become a better fighter. See 'help guilds'.
