order (minion name) as (nickname)

   Assigns a name to the minion.

order (minion name) to follow
order (minion name) to unfollow

   Orders a minion to start or stop following the player.

order (minion name) to front

   Orders a minion to protect the player and other minions of that player. Any mosters or players that turn aggressive can engage in melee combat with this minion alone.

order (minion name) to list commands
order (minion name) to (command)

   Depending on the minion, it may be ordered to perform various commands. Many of the commands are the same as those which are available to players as well, such as taking or dropping items. You can get a list of the commands available from a minion by ordering it to 'list commands'.
