
Help on: testing

The developement and testing server runs at
vermin.game-host.org 232

The most recent additions to the game can
be experienced there, but it is considerably
less stable. Reboots without warning and 
miscellaneous errors can and will happen.

Player databases for the stable and testing
servers are separate. No player data loss in
the testing server will be reimbursed, and
playing there is generally at the player's
own risk.
