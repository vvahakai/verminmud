Help on: title

Title is a honorific your character can earn by doing various
tasks, such as advancing to a certain level in a guild or
completing a quest. When you earn a title, it isn't automatically
visible to other players, you must first choose which title to
use from the ones you have aquired. 

When you select a title to use, it will be visible to other
players after your race. For example, if your characters is a 
giant named 'Smith' and you choose to use the title 'Newbie',
other players will see you as 'Smith the Giant Newbie'.

You can change your title at any time you wish.

To view your available titles, type 'set title'.
