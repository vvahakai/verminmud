Help on: guilds

Guilds are establishements maintained by practitioners of a certain
profession. They provide their members training and services related
to that profession in exchange for cash and experience points.
Guilds are the primary source of skills and advancement in VerminMUD.
The first thing a new character should do is to choose a guild and
join it.

Many guilds are located right in the Vermin city, and most of them
are happy to enroll new members for free. They charge money only
for training skills.

Several guilds are located in the outworld, and must be located by
exploring. Some of these are meant for experienced characters only
and are not suiltable for new players. All guilds in the Vermin city
are suitable for new characters.
