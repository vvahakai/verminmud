Alignment in Vermin World is determined as follows.

Any entity in the Vermin world may be aligned along two separate
axes:

- Life <-> Unlife
- Progress <-> Stagnation

These axes are defined by the following values and attributes:

Life:
   Favours:
   - the reign of natural law and the cycle of life
   - spreading and diversity of all living things
   - survival of the fittest
   Opposes:
   - lenghtening of life by unnatural or magical
     means, such as undeath
   - non-selective extinction of all life

Unlife:
   Favours:
   - subversion of natural laws
   - replication of life by unnatural means
   - sentinent constructs, undead
   Opposes:
   - life in all its forms

Progress:
   Favours:
   - action, change, chaos
   - upheaval of political and social conventions, war
   - creativity, construction, empirical science
   - rights of the individual, individualism 
   Opposes:
   - delay, inaction, dogmatism
   - bureaucracy, strict unchanging laws

Stagnation:
   Favours:
   - preservation, protection, stasis
   - law, authority
   - respect of tradition, preservation of knowledge
   - good of the community over the rights of an individual
   Opposes:
   - change, upheaval


For players, the alignment describes the values of the player
character in question. These values in turn affect the relations
of that player to the diverse gods of the vermin world. A player
is usually only accepted by religions devoted to a god that shares
his values. Other communities of the world, such as some guilds,
may also require a certain view of the world from their members.
