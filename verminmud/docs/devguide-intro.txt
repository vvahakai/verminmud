* VerminMUD Developer's Guide

** Introduction

Welcome to the VerminMUD Developer's Guide. The purpose of this document is to 
serve as a starting point or tutorial for new developers coming to the VerminMUD
project.

As you propably are aware, VerminMUD is a completely custom MUD started in the beginning
of 2002. Both the driver and the mudlib has been developed from scratch using the Java
programming language. 

** Prerequisites

This guide is meant to give examples and introduce the reader to the APIs of VerminMUD
and show how 3rd party developers can develop content for VerminMUD.

This document is not a general MUD guide, nor is it a programming or Java guide.
If you need help in Java programming see Sun Microsystem's Java site at \url{http://java.sun.com}.

** Before we start

This guide is divided into different sections. Each section describes some type of 
content development (eg. one chapter for creating a simple area). I will try to include
all necessary information in each chapter regarding the task at hand. If there are
some pieces of information required from other chapters, I will refer to those.

This document is still a "work in progres". Some chapters may be incomplete
or unclear. Please submit clarification requests and comments in the \url{http://verminmud.org}
forums or email me at tadex@verminmud.org.

The contents of this guide are as follows:
\bullets{
\item{VerminMUD objects and API overview}

For brevity, all examples might not be presented in full but the complete files
are in the developer guide distribution package under the examples directory.
