    <h1>VerminMUD Developer's Guide</h1>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the VerminMUD Developer's Guide. The purpose of this document is to 
    serve as a starting point or tutorial for new developers coming to the VerminMUD
    project.</p>
    <p>As you propably are aware, VerminMUD is a completely custom MUD started in the beginning
    of 2002. Both the driver and the mudlib has been developed from scratch using the Java
    programming language. </p>
    <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
    <p>This guide is meant to give examples and introduce the reader to the APIs of VerminMUD
    and show how 3rd party developers can develop content for VerminMUD.</p>
    <p>This document is not a general MUD guide, nor is it a programming or Java guide.
    If you need help in Java programming see Sun Microsystem's Java site at <a href='http://java.sun.com'>http://java.sun.com</a>.</p>
    <h1>Before we start</h1>
    <p>This guide is divided into different sections. Each section describes some type of 
    content development (eg. one chapter for creating a simple area). I will try to include
    all necessary information in each chapter regarding the task at hand. If there are
    some pieces of information required from other chapters, I will refer to those.</p>
